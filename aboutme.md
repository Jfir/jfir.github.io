### My story

Hi, my name is Jaouad (pronounced: Ja-wad) and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Ph.D. in Biotechnology (Modeling/Data Analytics), an MBA (Business Management, Roosevelt University, Chicago) and an MIS (Business Analytics, Roosevelt University, Chicago).

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tech and its impact on the future of our society. I use AWS, SQL, Python, Alteryx, QlikView and Tableau for my data projects.

As a data analyst and data scientist, I am an insanely curious person who always seek out to translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and achieve business goals.

I love to travel and explore different cultures.

### My Focus

{: .box-warning}
**Data analytics:** Get more value from your data with prediction models and machine learning techniques to predict behavior or target the right customer.

{: .box-note}
**Data analysis:** I am specialized in analyzing data. Results, trends and recommendations are clearly presented in reports or tools.

{: .box-error}
**AWS:** In contrary to Traditional ML development, I am fun of how Amazon web services SageMaker, help bring models from concept to production with high accuracy and low costs.

{: .box-note}
**Dashboards:** Dashboards show the most recent results in an interactive way. By clicking and drilling, you will examine trends and patterns.
