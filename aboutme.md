### My story

Hi, my name is Jaouad (pronounced: Ja-wad) and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Ph.D. in Biotechnology (Modeling/Data Analytics), an MBA (Business Management, Roosevelt University, Chicago) and an MIS (Business Analytics, Roosevelt University, Chicago).

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tech and its impact on the future of our society. I use AWS, SQL, Python, Alteryx, QlikView and Tableau for my data projects.

As a data analyst and data scientist, I am an insanely curious person who always seek out to translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.

I love to travel and explore different cultures.

### My story

{: .box-note}
**Data analysis:** I am specialized in analyzing data. Results, trends and recommendations are clearly presented in reports or tools.

{: .box-warning}
**Data analytics:** Get more value from your data with prediction models and machine learning techniques, for example by predicting behavior or targeting the right customer.

{: .box-error}
**AWS:** Present your data in an inspiring way by using an infographic rather than a piece of text. I create interactive infographics which can be used internally or publicly.

{: .box-note}
**Dashboards:** Dashboards show the most recent results in an interactive way. By clicking and drilling, you will examine trends and patterns.
