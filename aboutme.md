### My story

Hi, my name is Jaouad (pronounced: Ja-wad) and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Ph.D. in Biotechnology (Modeling/Data Analytics), an MBA (Business Management, Roosevelt University, Chicago) and an MIS (Business Analytics, Roosevelt University, Chicago).

I am experienced in machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use AWS, SQL, Python, Alteryx, QlikView and Tableau for my data projects.

As a data analyst and data scientist, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.
