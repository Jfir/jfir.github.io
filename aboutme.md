{: #puzzle}

Hi, my name is Jaouad (pronounced: Ja-wad) and I work as a data analyst/scientist. I hold a Ph.D. in Biotechnology (Modeling/Data Analytics), an MBA (Business Management, Roosevelt University, Chicago) and an MIS (Business Analytics, Roosevelt University, Chicago).

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tech and its impact on the future of our society. I use AWS, SQL, Python, Alteryx, QlikView and Tableau for my data projects.

As a data analyst and data scientist, I am an insanely curious person who always seek out to translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and achieve business goals.

I love to travel and explore different cultures.
