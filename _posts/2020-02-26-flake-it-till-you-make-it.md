It was not easy. I studied 4 weeks, 5 to 6 hours every day. I was under pressure and really tired certain moments but, guess what?! I did it today (28/03/2021) after only 30 days!

If you focus your energies and follow this plan...You can do the same!!
I'll be sharing here the basics steps you need to complete before taking the exam. You can of course take your time but if you need and want to complete it in few time possible follow a study plan!

Follow the bellow steps and you will be in good shape to take your exam.


First 10 days:
STUDY and learn all cloud concepts and AWS services: You only need to follow ONE course:


It is a 26hs course. It took me 10 days to complete it.

There are a lot of online courses out there. The best I would advice is this one from Udemy (Stefan Maaresk). Pay attention and take notes of everything!

At this point you think you are ready. BUT YOU ARE NOT!!

Next 20 days:
PRACTICE EXAMS!! This step you CANNOT ignore. Please try them all!

Every time you complete an exam:

review all the questions and answers.
Be sure you really understood the answers!!
Do this for each one of them until you start scoring more then 80%. Once you arrive at this point you are prepared!
Here the ones I used : Udemy (Jon Bonson)


and Whizlabs - aws-csaa-practice-tests


I didn't applied for the +30min for non-english native speakers but you can!

Book your exam and accommodation at least two weeks before the desired date ;)

GOOD LUCK!


## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic;
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2;
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
