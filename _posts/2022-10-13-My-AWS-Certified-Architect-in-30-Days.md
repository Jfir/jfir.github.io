I passed the very tough and difficult AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate exam and I’d like to share the preparation steps I did to pass the exam on my first try.
Study and learn all cloud concepts and AWS services: You only need to follow ONE course

all I am trying to do is share how I passed my exam, what study methods worked for me, and how you can plan out a path to passing the exam in 30 days if you stick to a strict regiment.

I also want to highlight that I took this course and passed with several years of AWS experience already under my belt. Now… that isn’t to say I had a huge leg-up on anyone starting out with no experience.

Most of my experience was just around EC2, S3, and IAM, basic core services that probably only makeup 10–15% of the AWS SAA-C02 exam… but I still did have prior experience to take the certification and I won’t deny that it helped me grasp some topics and concepts perhaps quicker than someone with zero to no experience. That being said, let’s get started…

### Conclusion

Finishing the certification is not the end of the story, in fact, this is just the beginning of my cloud journey. If you are interested, join me on this journey. I didn’t pass the exam with a high score, just barely passed. I still have a lot of things to learn about AWS. The exam motivated me to learn all these latest cloud technologies and the exam result keeps me learning. It is a lifelong learning process!
