It was not easy. I studied 4 weeks, 5 to 6 hours every day. I was under pressure and really tired certain moments but, guess what?! I did it today (28/03/2021) after only 30 days!

If you focus your energies and follow this plan...You can do the same!!
I'll be sharing here the basics steps you need to complete before taking the exam. You can of course take your time but if you need and want to complete it in few time possible follow a study plan!

Follow the bellow steps and you will be in good shape to take your exam.


First 10 days:
STUDY and learn all cloud concepts and AWS services: You only need to follow ONE course:


It is a 26hs course. It took me 10 days to complete it.

There are a lot of online courses out there. The best I would advice is this one from Udemy (Stefan Maaresk). Pay attention and take notes of everything!

At this point you think you are ready. BUT YOU ARE NOT!!

Next 20 days:
PRACTICE EXAMS!! This step you CANNOT ignore. Please try them all!

Every time you complete an exam:

review all the questions and answers.
Be sure you really understood the answers!!
Do this for each one of them until you start scoring more then 80%. Once you arrive at this point you are prepared!
Here the ones I used : Udemy (Jon Bonson)


and Whizlabs - aws-csaa-practice-tests


I didn't applied for the +30min for non-english native speakers but you can!
